Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Data Scientist position at Paramount. My fascination with automation and data began in childhood, where I’d find myself constantly looking for ways to streamline even the simplest of household chores. Over time, this passion for making tasks more efficient evolved into a career in data science, where I have been able to turn my love for problem-solving into impactful, real-world solutions. The idea of contributing to Paramount’s mission in the ever-evolving world of on-demand, over-the-top streaming is something that deeply resonates with me, as it combines my love for data with my long-standing passion for the entertainment industry.

From a young age, I’ve been captivated by the intersection of technology and media. In high school, I realized just how powerful data could be in shaping the way we consume content. The ability to predict viewer behavior, optimize recommendations, and use data-driven insights to influence creative decisions fascinated me—and it's this very passion that has driven me throughout my academic and professional journey.

Over the years, I’ve honed my ability to automate complex processes and make data more accessible and actionable. Whether it’s automating workflows using Python or building data pipelines that scale across organizations, I’ve always found myself naturally drawn to tasks that allow me to streamline and simplify. My strong command of SQL, Python (especially Pandas and Scikit-Learn), and experience with cloud platforms like AWS has allowed me to create efficient, scalable solutions that empower teams to make data-driven decisions with confidence.

What truly sets me apart, however, is my communication skills and my ability to take complex, technical insights and translate them into something meaningful for diverse stakeholders. I love turning data into a story—one that not only informs but also inspires action. Whether it’s building interactive dashboards in Tableau or crafting predictive models, I ensure the insights I generate are clear, actionable, and drive results. 

Paramount’s role in shaping the future of entertainment excites me, especially in today’s world where data plays such a key role in understanding and catering to viewer preferences. I’ve always admired how Paramount has leveraged cutting-edge technology to enhance its over-the-top streaming services and improve the user experience. The opportunity to contribute to this vision, by using my skills in data automation, machine learning, and predictive analytics, is something I am genuinely passionate about. 

I would love to bring my unique blend of technical expertise and passion for media to Paramount. Thank you for considering my application. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can help support your team’s continued innovation in the streaming space.

Sincerely,  
Shriya Dikshith
