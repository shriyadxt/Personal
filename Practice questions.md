## Self-Contained Python Interview Questions

**Self-contained Python interview questions** typically involve solving a problem or writing a function without relying on external libraries or data. They focus on your core Python knowledge, problem-solving skills, and ability to write clean, efficient code.

### Example Questions:

#### Basic Python
* **Write a Python function to reverse a string.**
* **Implement a function to find the factorial of a number.**
* **Create a Python program to check if a given number is a prime number.**
* **Write a function to find the longest common subsequence of two strings.**
* **Implement a binary search algorithm in Python.**

#### Data Structures and Algorithms
* **Given a list of integers, find the second largest element.**
* **Implement a stack using a list.**
* **Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.**
* **Implement a queue using two stacks.**
* **Given a list of integers, find the first non-repeating element.**

#### Object-Oriented Programming
* **Create a Python class to represent a bank account with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance.**
* **Explain the difference between inheritance and polymorphism.**
* **Implement a simple class hierarchy for shapes (e.g., circle, rectangle, triangle).**

#### Problem-Solving and Logic
* **Write a Python function to flatten a nested list.**
* **Given a list of numbers, find the pair of numbers that adds up to a given target.**
* **Implement a function to find the longest word in a sentence.**

### Tips for Answering
* **Explain your thought process:** Clearly articulate your approach to solving the problem.
* **Write clean and readable code:** Use meaningful variable names and proper indentation.
* **Consider time and space complexity:** Analyze the efficiency of your solution.
* **Test your code:** If possible, write test cases to verify the correctness of your solution.
