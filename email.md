Hi Anila,

I hope this message finds you well.

I recently joined Amazon as an AI Content Specialist, working out of the BOS17 office. I came across an open position you're hiring for (mention the specific job title if you know it), and I'm very interested in the opportunity.

My experience in AI content creation aligns well with the skills and qualifications you might be seeking. I'd love to learn more about the role and how my skills could contribute to your team.

Please feel free to reach out to me at my work email (mention your work email if you have one) or my personal email (shriya5dxt@gmail.com) to discuss further.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
